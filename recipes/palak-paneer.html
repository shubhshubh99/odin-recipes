        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Palak paneer</strong> is a popular dish from North India (Punjab). 
            Here soft paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cubes are simmered 
            into smooth, creamy, medium spicy, vibrant green spinach gravy.

        <p>
            This tastes exactly restaurant style Palak paneer. If you are 
            one of them who thinks that any spinach dish is bland and tasteless, 
            then I bet you haven't tried this recipe. Try it once, I am sure you
            will love it.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <ol class="center-ol">
            
                <li>To a pot of boiling water, add little salt and then 
                    spinach leaves to it. Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 to 3 
                    minutes until wilted.</li>
                <li>Take them out and put them in ice cold water. This helps 
                    the leaves in retaining their green color.</li>
                <li>To a blender, add the blanched spinach along with tomato, 
                    3 cloves of garlic, ginger and green chili. Puree to a smooth paste 
                    and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add the oil and then add the 
                    remaining 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Sauté for few minutes until it
                    starts changing color.</li>
                <li>Then add the chopped onions. Cook the onion for 2 to 3 minutes until 
                    soft and translucent.</li>
                <li>Add in the prepared spinach puree and mix. Also add around 1/2 cup water
                    at the point.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium heat. The spinach 
                    will bubble a lot. Stir at regular intervals to avoid sticking at the 
                    bottom.</li>
                <li>Once the spinach is cooked, add the garam masala, turmeric powder, 
                    red chilli powder and salt. Mix and cook for 1 minute. You may also 
                    add ½ teaspoon of sugar at this point if you like.</li>
                <li>Then add the heavy cream and mix.</li>
                <li>Stir in the paneer and mix. Let the curry simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. 
                    Switch off the flame, add lemon juice and kasuri methi and mix.</li>
                <li>Serve palak paneer hot with naan or roti or rice.</li>
